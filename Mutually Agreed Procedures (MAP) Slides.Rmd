## Slide 1: What is MAP?

Mutually Agreed Procedures (MAP) is a process through which two or more countries' tax authorities work together to resolve tax disputes and avoid double taxation.

## Slide 2: MAP Process Steps

1. **Initiation**: The taxpayer requests assistance from their tax authority.
2. **Negotiation**: The tax authorities work to resolve the issue.
3. **Agreement**: A final agreement is made between the countries involved.

## Slide 3: Benefits of MAP

- Reduces the risk of double taxation.
- Improves consistency in tax treatment.
- Promotes international cooperation between tax authorities.

## Slide 4: Example of MAP Usage

A company based in Kenya disputes its tax treatment in the U.S., and both tax authorities agree on a resolution through MAP, ensuring the company is not taxed twice on the same income.
