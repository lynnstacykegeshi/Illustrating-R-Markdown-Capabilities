# Illustration of R Markdown Features

We illusrate R Markdown Capabilities in the below texts.

##  Illustrating Inline elements
Hello! I am a passionate **software developer** with a background in *computer science* and *mathematics*. I graduated with **first-class honors** in Actuarial Science from the *University of Nairobi*. Currently, I am working as a **tax advisor** at *Ernst & Young Kenya*, where I apply my knowledge in data analysis and machine learning to help solve complex challenges.

I have a strong interest in the intersection of **technology** and **art**, and I enjoy exploring innovative ways to use **data science** and **AI** in solving real-world problems. I am also passionate about keeping up to date with the latest **technology trends**.

##  Illustrating Block-level elements

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Reading and writing
- Catching up on the latest medical dramas.
- Crocheting 

My favourite quote that guides my daily life is:

> "Never be so kind. You forget to be clever. Never be so clever. You forget to be kind Â·"

# Illustrating Mathematical Expressions
Once in a while we have to write some mathematical expressions

1.The formular can be left inside the textto look as follows $x + y = 30$
2. If we want the formular to be on the next line we can: $$x+y-30$$
3. We can also use latex notation to present mathematical formulation.
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^x}{3x}+4x^2 \, dx$$
# Including figures from the computer
With the emergence of ChatGPT, i sometimes use it to generate images for creative inspiration. See below a sunset image i generated using ChatGPT.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Sunset.jpg")

```

We can also include graphs in or markdown

```{r}

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(pressure, pch = 19, type = "b")
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```

# R Notebook
R Notebook is interactive and more suited for exploratory analysis and immediate feedback. Both R Markdownare based on R Markdown, but R Notebook enhances the experience by allowing live code execution and interactive exploration.

In this notebook, we explore the marathon data from a CSV file. We will visualize the distribution of finish times and compare finish times for different runner types.

First, we load the data and necessary libraries.
```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
marathon_data <- read.csv("Marathon.csv")

```
 
We then view the first 5 rows just to get a glimpse of what we are working with.
```{r}
# View the first few rows of the data
head(marathon_data)
```
